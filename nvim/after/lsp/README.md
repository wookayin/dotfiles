This directory contains per-LSP configuration (*override*) on top of
the base LSP configuration provided by [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig).

You can verify a resolved LSP config (passed to `vim.lsp.config(...)`) by
`:checkhealth vim.lsp` (or `:LspInfo`).

See also `:help lsp-config-merge`.
